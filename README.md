# Substring Frequency Counter

The "Substring Frequency Counter" is a Ruby function that takes a word and a dictionary of substrings as input. It returns a hash that contains the substrings from the dictionary and their frequencies of occurrence in the word. The function is case-insensitive, meaning it will match substrings regardless of their case.

The function iterates over each substring in the dictionary and searches for occurrences of the substring in the word. It maintains a frequency counter for each substring, incrementing it for each occurrence found. If a substring is found at least once, it is added to the result hash along with its frequency.

The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample dictionary and input word. The dictionary contains various substrings, and the function counts their frequencies in the given word. The results are displayed using the `puts` method, showcasing the frequencies of the substrings found in the word.

This "Substring Frequency Counter" provides a convenient way to analyze the occurrences of substrings in a given word, enabling tasks such as text analysis, data processing, and pattern matching.
